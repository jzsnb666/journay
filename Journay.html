<body><h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
  <P>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</P>
  <h2>August 20, 2012</h2>

  <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: 
    .</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
    <li>Magic City, ID</li>
    <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
    <li>Last Change, CO</li>
    <li>Why, AZ</li>
    <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
    </ol>
  <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
  <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: "Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity." I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>

    My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
    everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
    I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
    <li>cell phone</li>
    <li>ipod</li>
    <li>digital camera</li>
    <li>a protein bar</li>
    Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
